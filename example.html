<h2>My Favorite President</h2>
<p>
I want to say that <span data-ref="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln|Abe Lincoln|Wikipedia">Abe Lincoln</span> was my favorite president.
He was definitely preferable to <span data-ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_A._Arthur|Chester A. Arthur|Wikipedia, see also |https://www.biography.com/people/chester-a-arthur-9190059|Chester A. Arthur Biography Lawyer, U.S. Vice President, U.S. President (1829-1886)|A+E Television Networks, November 21, 2016">Chester A. Arthur.</span>.
There are some people, however, who think Arthur was quite <span data-ref="https://brandongaille.com/19-fabulous-chester-a-arthur-quotes/">a wit,</span>
but I am <span data-ref="At least not very much.">not impressed.</span>
You can use <span data-ref="https://www.duckduckgo.com|http://www.startpage.com">your favorite search engine</span> to find out more about the presidents.
